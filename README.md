# Data Structures Implemented in Rust

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Rust. These implementations are for educational purposes and future references.
## Currently Implemented Data Structures

1. **Binary Tree**  
   A classic binary tree implementation with basic operations like insertion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)

2. **B-Tree**  
   A balanced tree data structure optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. Includes operations like insertion, splitting, and traversal.
